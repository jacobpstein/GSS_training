# Spatial Regression (a gentle intro)
A repo for presentation materials on spatial regression to the Ghana Statistical Service.

Many of the resources from this session come from the much smarter folks at various universities. Please check out the following links:

- [Spatial Regression in R](http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~ssun/R-Spatial/spregression.html#spatial-autocorrelation)
- [Spatial Data](https://r-spatial.org/book/16-SpatialRegression.html)
- [Noli Brazil's Spatial Analysis Lab](https://crd230.github.io/lab8.html): we walked through this in the session
- [Bayesian Workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01808)

This repo features the main markdown file for simulating spatial data, as well as files to render the slides.
